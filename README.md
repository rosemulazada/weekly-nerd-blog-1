# (Weekly Nerd) Blog
My repo for my Weekly Nerd blog, a place to share and store my insights from these guest speakers from the minor Web Design and Development 2024, and to blog about my findings in front-end development generally.

To start off, I've always been fascinated by the idea of running a blog but I wanted to document something specific so I could watch myself grow in that aspect. I never quite found the thing I wanted to document for it, however. Sure, I could do it about art, but I never drew enough to do so and it didn't quite excite me enough to make a fully fledged blog about it. However, as we've been tasked by the minor Web Design and Development to make a blogsite where we document the Weekly Nerd lectures*, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to go ahead and do it on code: or more specifically, my process as an ever-learning developer.

Now, I could do this plain and simple, vanilla code: make a strict template for each blog page in CSS and hold onto that. I considered this and while I think it's good to stick to the fundamentals as closely as possible (which I certainly will do), I also want to learn something new, to challenge myself as as developer.

For this blog, I've decided to try to load in the pages dynamically using Express.js and EJS. I'll be making my start with Express by following Andrew Meads course on Node.js on Udemy.

Other than that, I have no set plans besides the fact that I want to use as many things I learned from the Weekly Nerd blogs and that I hope to use as little JavaScript besides the routing as I can. The only reason I'm letting Express.js fly is because I have tested it and it can run in communication with the browser and make HTTPRequests even when JavaScript is disabled. I'm kind of winging this as I go, so any decisions I make, I'll be documenting them here.

*The Weekly Nerd is a (you guessed it) weekly lecture that us developers get during the minor Web Design and Development at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. We're meant to document our notes from it, and reflect on it: what did it make us think about? What have we learnt from it? Is there anything we've learnt that we'll take with us into the workfield?
